# ## SVM Classifier
# 
# Your code for this section will all be written inside **cs231n/classifiers/linear_svm.py**. 
# 
# As you can see, we have prefilled the function `compute_loss_naive` which uses for loops to evaluate the multiclass SVM loss function. 

# In[3]:

# Evaluate the naive implementation of the loss we provided for you:
from cs231n.classifiers.linear_svm import svm_loss_naive
import time

# generate a random SVM weight matrix of small numbers
W = np.random.randn(3073, 10) * 0.0001
print W

loss, grad = svm_loss_naive(W, X_dev, y_dev, 0.00001)
print 'loss: %f' % (loss, )


# The `grad` returned from the function above is right now all zero. Derive and implement the gradient for the SVM cost function and implement it inline inside the function `svm_loss_naive`. You will find it helpful to interleave your new code inside the existing function.
# 
# To check that you have correctly implemented the gradient correctly, you can numerically estimate the gradient of the loss function and compare the numeric estimate to the gradient that you computed. We have provided code that does this for you:

# In[ ]:

# Once you've implemented the gradient, recompute it with the code below
# and gradient check it with the function we provided for you

# Compute the loss and its gradient at W.
loss, grad = svm_loss_naive(W, X_dev, y_dev, 0.0)

# Numerically compute the gradient along several randomly chosen dimensions, and
# compare them with your analytically computed gradient. The numbers should match
# almost exactly along all dimensions.
from cs231n.gradient_check import grad_check_sparse
f = lambda w: svm_loss_naive(w, X_dev, y_dev, 0.0)[0]
grad_numerical = grad_check_sparse(f, W, grad)

# do the gradient check once again with regularization turned on
# you didn't forget the regularization gradient did you?
loss, grad = svm_loss_naive(W, X_dev, y_dev, 1e2)
f = lambda w: svm_loss_naive(w, X_dev, y_dev, 1e2)[0]
grad_numerical = grad_check_sparse(f, W, grad)


# ### Inline Question 1:
# It is possible that once in a while a dimension in the gradcheck will not match exactly. What could such a discrepancy be caused by? Is it a reason for concern? What is a simple example in one dimension where a gradient check could fail? *Hint: the SVM loss function is not strictly speaking differentiable*
# 
# **Your Answer:** *fill this in.*

# In[ ]:

# Next implement the function svm_loss_vectorized; for now only compute the loss;
# we will implement the gradient in a moment.
tic = time.time()
loss_naive, grad_naive = svm_loss_naive(W, X_dev, y_dev, 0.00001)
toc = time.time()
print 'Naive loss: %e computed in %fs' % (loss_naive, toc - tic)

print 'Vectorized loss: %e computed in %fs' % (loss_vectorized, toc - tic)

# The losses should match but your vectorized implementation should be much faster.
print 'difference: %f' % (loss_naive - loss_vectorized)


# In[ ]:

# Complete the implementation of svm_loss_vectorized, and compute the gradient
# of the loss function in a vectorized way.

# The naive implementation and the vectorized implementation should match, but
# the vectorized version should still be much faster.
tic = time.time()
_, grad_naive = svm_loss_naive(W, X_dev, y_dev, 0.00001)
toc = time.time()
print 'Naive loss and gradient: computed in %fs' % (toc - tic)

tic = time.time()
_, grad_vectorized = svm_loss_vectorized(W, X_dev, y_dev, 0.00001)
toc = time.time()
print 'Vectorized loss and gradient: computed in %fs' % (toc - tic)

# The loss is a single number, so it is easy to compare the values computed
# by the two implementations. The gradient on the other hand is a matrix, so
# we use the Frobenius norm to compare them.
difference = np.linalg.norm(grad_naive - grad_vectorized, ord='fro')
print 'difference: %f' % difference


# ### Stochastic Gradient Descent
# 
# We now have vectorized and efficient expressions for the loss, the gradient and our gradient matches the numerical gradient. We are therefore ready to do SGD to minimize the loss.

# In[ ]:

# In the file linear_classifier.py, implement SGD in the function
# LinearClassifier.train() and then run it with the code below.

toc = time.time()
print 'That took %fs' % (toc - tic)


# In[ ]:

# A useful debugging strategy is to plot the loss as a function of
# iteration number:
plt.plot(loss_hist)
plt.xlabel('Iteration number')
plt.ylabel('Loss value')

# In[ ]:

# Use the validation set to tune hyperparameters (regularization strength and

# rates and regularization strengths; if you are careful you should be able to
# get a classification accuracy of about 0.4 on the validation set.

regularization_strengths = [5e4, 1e5]

# of data points that are correctly classified.
